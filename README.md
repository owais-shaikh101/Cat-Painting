# fCC Cat Painting

This repository contains a project showcasing a simple, visually appealing cat face created using HTML and CSS. The cat face is styled using CSS shapes and positioning techniques, resulting in a playful and interactive representation of a cat's face, complete with eyes, ears, whiskers, nose, and mouth.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The cat face adjusts to different screen sizes and is centered on the page.
- **CSS Shapes and Styling**: The cat's features (ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers) are created using CSS borders, transformations, and gradients.
- **No JavaScript**: The design relies purely on HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page, including the cat's face elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the cat's face, including the use of border-radius, transformations, and positioning to achieve the desired look.
